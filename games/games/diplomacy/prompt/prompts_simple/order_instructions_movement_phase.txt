# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Reason
  - comprehensive reasoning about your move decisions
2. Output Moves in JSON
  - aim to return an order for each of your units.

Respond with this exact format:

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": ["order1", "order2", ...]
}}
