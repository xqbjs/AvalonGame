# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed adjustment orders
2. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F STP/NC B'
  - Only fleet builds need coast specification.

# Adjustment Phase Orders:
You have two main order types in the adjustment phase:
Build: '[UnitType] [Location] B'
e.g. 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
Disband: '[UnitType] [Location] D'
e.g. 'A PAR D', 'F LON D'

Your Task:
1. Reason
  - comprehensive reasoning about your adjustment decisions
2. Output Moves in JSON
  - return all build/disband orders needed

Respond with this exact format:

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": ["order1", "order2", ...]
}}
